# Persistent Codex Handoff

## Single source of truth

- Persistent branch: `codex/persistent-workspace`.
- Communication channel: Draft PR #12 targeting `main`.
- Keep PR #12 open, Draft, and unmerged unless the user explicitly requests merge.
- The **newest top-level PR comment marked authoritative** supplies the exact SHA and the only active Codex task.
- Older validation/task comments are historical evidence only and must not be executed.

## Role split — strict

### Web ChatGPT owns all repository changes

Web ChatGPT performs every source/test/docs/config/workflow/generated-asset/dependency/API/UI repair and push.

Codex/Luna must **not** edit, commit, push, format, or repair repository files, including tiny import/formatting fixes. If validation finds a repository defect, report exact evidence and stop that failing gate; Web ChatGPT will publish the next exact SHA.

### Codex/Luna owns only host-local execution evidence

Codex is used only for work that Web ChatGPT cannot perform on the user's local Windows validation host:

- restore/create the canonical local Python environment on that host;
- verify the already-present local SFINCS executable and its SHA-256;
- run the local launcher under the exact PR SHA;
- perform real same-origin HTTP checks against the locally running process;
- exercise external providers from the local host;
- run the strongest safe tiny Full 1 m SFINCS execution using the already-present permitted executable;
- report local filesystem/process/provider/engine behavior.

No SFINCS download, installation, copying, or redistribution is authorized.

## Current product priority

A **reviewable Full 1 m vertical slice** has priority over deeper Adaptive work.

Review scope:

- location / area / rainfall input;
- Full 1 m resource estimate;
- run creation;
- visible run stages;
- cancellation;
- honest provider/engine failure state;
- real tiny Full 1 m execution when providers and the permitted SFINCS executable are available.

Deferred until user review:

- Adaptive enablement;
- Adaptive subgrid/forcing/result normalization;
- Full-vs-Adaptive benchmark acceptance;
- final result-map UX;
- packaging/installer.

Adaptive remains disabled by `GRID_ADAPTIVE_NOT_AVAILABLE`.

## Canonical local-review environment

`environment.yml` is the only environment contract for local review and validation.

It pins Python 3.12.10 and the required GIS/HydroMT/HydroMT-SFINCS stack. `requirements.txt` is not the canonical review environment.

Web-owned repository support:

```text
python -m scripts.bootstrap_local_review
python -m scripts.run_local_review --check-env
python -m scripts.run_local_review
```

The launcher now fails early with a clear diagnostic when the active Python/package versions are not canonical, before importing Uvicorn or starting the application.

Normal frontend rebuild requires Node.js 22.

## Web-owned deterministic validation

`.github/workflows/local-review-ci.yml` now performs the deterministic checks Web can own without the user's local SFINCS executable:

- create `environment.yml`;
- launcher canonical-environment preflight;
- Ruff;
- mypy;
- full pytest;
- `git diff --check`;
- Node.js 22;
- `npm ci`;
- `api:check`;
- TypeScript typecheck;
- Vitest;
- Vite build;
- verify `index.html` and `smoke.html` survive the build;
- start the real FastAPI local-review launcher;
- HTTP 200 for `/`, `/smoke.html`, and health;
- Full 1 m 500 m x 500 m estimate = 250,000 cells.

Codex must not duplicate these checks merely to compensate for missing local dependencies. Use CI evidence first.

## Latest local-host blocker before this cleanup

At exact head `d33e4708b5c91e7ef607fe1fc6ce8be7cb63af9e`, Codex confirmed the Ruff repair but the local host no longer had the canonical Python 3.12.10 environment. Host Python 3.14.3 lacked the pinned GIS/HydroMT dependencies, so mypy/pytest could not collect. This was correctly classified as an environment availability blocker, not a repository behavior failure.

Web has now added environment bootstrap/preflight/documentation and deterministic CI so that this condition is explicit and reproducible.

## Local SFINCS

A permitted existing SFINCS 2.4.0 Galibier executable was previously found on the validation host at:

```text
SFINCS_2026_01_release/SFINCS_v2.4.0_Galibier_release_exe/sfincs.exe
```

Codex may use this existing file only after the newest authoritative exact-SHA instruction says to do so.

## Reporting rule

For the active exact SHA, Codex should return only:

- local environment restoration result;
- exact launcher command and URL;
- local HTTP observations not already established by CI;
- external-provider stage/results;
- existing SFINCS path + SHA-256;
- Full 1 m real-engine stage/return code/log/result-file evidence;
- confirmed repository defect(s), if any, with minimal repro;
- external blockers;
- final worktree state;
- disposition: `local-review-ready | needs-web-fix | blocked-external`.

Do not propose or make repository fixes. Do not resume Adaptive work unless a later authoritative comment explicitly changes priority.
